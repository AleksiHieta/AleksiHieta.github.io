NOTES:

Install "Live Server" extension before running

If you set "border-radius" to half of the width, you get a circle image

Start with a quick validation for issues with display
    "validator.w3.org" can be used for html validation by 'file upload'
    "jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" for css validation

Don't use b or i elements as they should be covered by css style

Don't use headings by size, instead they should be used by importance
    and then resized as needed
Good practice is to have only one h1 element - it confuses search engines
Use headers in descending order. h1, h2, h3, ..., h6

HTML entities at dev.w3.org is helpful for listing special chars

<a> is for all links. Can link to another page, a file, or a download
    https://google.com for 'href' goes to a whole new site
    use attribute=_blank for opening a new tab

For images go to unsplash.com
